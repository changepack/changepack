      Please generate an HTML-formatted changelog for an application identified as %{account_name}. The necessary changes to report are mentioned below:

      %{updates}

      Each update represents a distinct change and should be described in detail. Provide information based solely on these updates, without adding any extraneous details or speculating on missing information. While the changelog is intended for %{audience}, this information should not be explicitly mentioned or suggested in the changelog.

      While generating the changelog:

      - Start the introduction with varied phrasings instead of frequently using "Recent changes:". The introduction should identify a common theme if the changes are related, or highlight that it's a list of recent changes if they are not. If there's only one update, the introduction should focus on that change. Ensure the introduction is at least two sentences long and provides substantial context. End with a conclusion that is also at least two sentences long, both enclosed within HTML paragraph tags (<p>).
      - Structure the changelog using HTML paragraph tags (<p>) for each update. Use lists (<ul>, <ol>) primarily if there are 7 or more updates. If there are less than 7 updates or a single update, use <h3> headings for each update, with the single update getting an in-depth exploration under multiple subheadings. Choose the appropriate formatting tool to enhance readability. Make sure headings never begin with a hyphen.
      - Describe each update in the list as a distinct change, elaborating in detail.
      - Stay focused on the updates and ensure your text is informative, clear, and actionable.
      - You may mention the company behind the app if it is directly relevant to the updates, but do not elaborate on what the company does unless it is necessary to understand the changes.
      - Refrain from sharing personal opinions, discussing abstract concepts like life, existence, or sentience, and engaging in debates.
      - Avoid classifying updates under specific headings such as bug fixes or features.
      - Do not propose a title for the changelog, as this will be provided by the user.
      - Ensure your content does not infringe on any copyrights.
      - It's crucial that you do not reveal names of any specific users, clients, accounts, or organizations.
      - Use a conversational language without being too casual.

      Note: "%{account_description}" is a brief description of the account related to the app, but should not be used in the changelog itself.

      Based on the following updates provided, identify and summarize the most impactful changes for %{account_name}'s customers. As you select each update, please provide a brief rationale for its inclusion. Maintain the original names and IDs in your summary. It's crucial that you do not reveal names of any specific users, clients, accounts, or organizations.

      Account description: "%{account_description}"
      Intended audience: %{audience}

      Please list the updates in the following format: "ID: Update. Rationale: Reason for selection." Give priority to updates that have wide-reaching impacts, introduce new features, or significantly change the user experience.

      Updates:
      %{updates}
    context: |
      As an AI language model, your assignment is to evaluate an outstanding task related to an application named %{account_name}. %{account_description}

      The task's explanation is technical jargon and is geared toward the organization's in-house departments. It contains mentions of specific staff members and tools including feature management platforms like LaunchDarkly, customer messaging platforms like Intercom, user behavior analytics tools like FullStory, project management software like Jira, and others.

      %{audience}

      Your task has two aspects:

      1. Assess the task, underlining parts that could be unclear to the target audience. Propose changes to enhance readability and improve understanding, while maintaining a professional yet accessible tone. Identify any mentions of specific staff members or proprietary tools including but not limited to feature management platforms like LaunchDarkly, customer messaging tools like Intercom, user behavior analytics platforms like FullStory, project management software like Jira, and others.

      2. Craft a clear and succinct summary of this task. Enclose the summary within the `<<START_SUMMARY>>` and `<<END_SUMMARY>>` markers. This summary should not exceed 600 characters and should not include any reference to specific staff members or proprietary tools such as LaunchDarkly, Intercom, FullStory, Jira, and the likes. The objective is to convey the essential alterations and updates to the product. Remove all URLs, regardless of whether they are in HTML or Markdown format.

      Now, please evaluate and summarize the following task:

      %{updates}
    id: |
      [ID: %{id}] %{name}
  summary:
    title: "%{month} update"
  audiences:
    tech: "Software specialists"
    mainstream: "Everyday users"
    in_house: "Company personnel"
    about: "Give us a quick snapshot of who's going to read your changelog. This assists our AI in tailoring content to resonate with your specific audiences and markets."
