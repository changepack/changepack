Every week, Changepack delivers a brief update to you or your company, highlighting the progress your team achieved in the past week, all powered by ChatGPT. Itâ€™s a great way to keep folks informed about new changes and features, ensuring everyone stays connected and up-to-date!

## Features

* **Weekly summaries.** Each week, Changepack handpicks the most notable updates and emails you a release note. We leverage OpenAIâ€™s [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) to publish your content in seconds.
* **Pull commits from GitHub.** You can link Changepack with your GitHub activity, making it easy to track progress. (GitLab coming soon!)
* **Retrieve issues from Linear.** We connect to project management tools of your choice, allowing ChatGPT to stay informed about your current tasks. (Other tools coming soon.)

## Use cases

* As a manager, I can receive weekly email updates on my teamâ€™s progress from GitHub, eliminating the need to constantly ask them for status updates.
* As a programmer, I can receive a summary of my work from the previous week and share it in my teamâ€™s status update channel on Slack, so everyone is informed about what Iâ€™ve shipped.
