## Features

* **Write release notes 10x faster with AI.** Leverage OpenAIâ€™s [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) to publish your content in seconds.
* **Pull commits from GitHub.** Changepack allows you to link changelogs with your GitHub activity, making it easy to track progress. (GitLab coming soon!)
* **Retrieve issues from Linear.** We connect changelogs to project management tools of your choice, allowing ChatGPT to stay informed about your current tasks. (Other tools coming soon.)
* **Monthly automated summaries.** Each month, Changepack handpicks the most notable updates and creates a release note draft for you to review and publish.
