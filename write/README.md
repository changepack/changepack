# Write

The `write` bounded context is responsible for managing and handling the creation and management of content within the system. It focuses on providing functionality for creating, updating, and publishing various types of content, such as posts and changelogs.

## Models

The `write` bounded context includes the following models:

* `Newsletter`: Represents a changelog, sent in a form of a newsletter, which is a collection of posts documenting changes and updates.
* `Post`: Represents a post within a changelog, containing content and metadata.
* `Publication`: A service object that facilitates the creation and updating of posts, incorporating associated updates and managing their publication status.
* `Source`: Represents a source of updates, such as a repository or team, providing essential information for filtering and reporting purposes.
* `Update`: Represents an update within a source, such as a commit or issue, containing relevant information and metadata.
* `Filter`: Represents a set of criteria used to include or exclude updates based on their content, type, or source. It supports dynamic filtering of updates to ensure that only relevant changes are documented and published.
* `Sydney`: A service object that interfaces with OpenAI's GPT to generate content based on updates. It supports operations like writing, choosing, and describing, utilizing AI to enhance content creation.


## Features and functionality

The `write` bounded context provides the following features and functionality:

1. Creation and management of changelogs and posts: Users can create and manage changelogs, which serve as containers for organizing and documenting changes. Within each changelog, users can create, update, and publish posts.
2. Integration with sources and updates: The `write` context integrates with the `connect` context to receive updates from sources like repositories and teams. These updates can be attached to posts within changelogs, providing a consolidated view of changes and updates.
3. Status management: Posts and updates can have different statuses, such as draft or published, allowing users to control the visibility and publication of their content.
4. Rich content creation: Users can create content for posts using rich text editing capabilities, enabling them to format and structure their content effectively.

## Collaboration with other bounded contexts

The `write` bounded context collaborates with other bounded contexts to fulfill its functionality:

1. Collaboration with the `connect` context: The `write` context receives updates from the `connect` context, incorporating them into posts within changelogs. This collaboration ensures that the content reflects the latest changes and updates from sources like repositories and teams.
2. Collaboration with the `platform` context: The `write` context integrates with the `platform` context to handle user authentication and registration. This integration allows users to access and utilize their accounts within the `write` context.

By collaborating with other contexts, the `write` bounded context ensures the seamless flow of information and functionality across different aspects of the system.

## Conclusion

The `write` bounded context plays a crucial role in managing and documenting changes and updates within the system. By providing functionality for creating and managing changelogs, posts, and updates, it enables users to effectively communicate and publish content, keeping stakeholders informed about the latest changes and developments.
