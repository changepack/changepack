module Discard::Model::ClassMethods
  # Discards the records by instantiating each
  # record and calling its {#discard} method.
  # Each object's callbacks are executed.
  # Returns the collection of objects that were discarded.
  #
  # Note: Instantiation, callback execution, and update of each
  # record can be time consuming when you're discarding many records at
  # once. It generates at least one SQL +UPDATE+ query per record (or
  # possibly more, to enforce your callbacks). If you want to discard many
  # rows quickly, without concern for their associations or callbacks, use
  # #update_all(discarded_at: Time.current) instead.
  #
  # ==== Examples
  #
  #   Person.where(age: 0..18).discard_all
