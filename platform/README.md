# Platform

The `platform` bounded context is a horizontal context that provides foundational functionality and services that are shared across other bounded contexts within the application. It contains essential models, concerns, and utilities that facilitate the development and integration of other contexts. Together, they create a set of reusable components and services that streamline the development process and promote consistency across different parts of the application.

## Models

* `Account` represents an organization or user account within the Platform context, providing attributes for account information, such as name, description, and website. It establishes associations with key models, enabling user and resource management at the account level.

* `User` represents individual users within the Platform context, handling authentication and authorization. It establishes associations with the Account model, facilitating user-account relationships and enabling secure access to resources.

* `Event` represents an event that can be published and subscribed to by different parts of the application. It provides methods for handling events, managing metadata, and retrieving event data.

* `Handler` is a base class for event handlers that process incoming events. It subscribes to specific events and executes the appropriate logic when those events are received.

## Concerns

The `platform` bounded context includes the following key features:

* `Domain` provides functionality for managing and validating domain-related attributes, such as the domain name associated with an account. It ensures that domain names are valid and unique within the system.

* `Identifier` adds a unique identifier to models, enabling them to be easily referenced and accessed within the system. It includes methods for generating and managing identifiers.

* `Inquirer` provides a mechanism for creating inquirer methods on models. An inquirer method allows for querying the state of an attribute in a more expressive and readable way.

* `Resourcable` provides functionality for automatically triggering events when a resource is created, updated, or destroyed. It simplifies the process of publishing events related to resource changes.

* `Status` concern enables models to have a status attribute and provides methods for managing and querying the status of a model. It includes functionality for transitioning between different states and validating the current state.

* `Provided` adds support for tracking and managing external providers associated with a model. It allows models to define provider attributes and automatically trigger events when providers are added or removed.

## Communication with other contexts

The `platform` bounded context is designed to be seamlessly integrated with other bounded contexts within the application. Its models, concerns, and utilities can be directly accessed and utilized by other contexts without the need for event-driven communication.

Other bounded contexts can freely utilize the functionality provided by the `platform` context, such as accessing common models, including concerns, and reusing utilities. This promotes code reuse, consistency, and reduces development effort across multiple contexts. The `platform` context is also leveraged to access utilities like the `Clock` module for managing time-based events and the `Event` model for publishing and subscribing to events.

For example, the `write` context collaborates with the `platform` context by leveraging its models and concerns. The `write` context can freely access and utilize models such as `Account` or `User` and concerns like `Slug` or `Active`. This seamless integration enables the `write` context to leverage the foundational functionality provided by the `platform` context.

## Further information

For more details and information on the components provided by the `platform` bounded context, refer to the individual README files of the models, concerns, and utilities within the context. Additionally, consult the documentation and guidelines provided by the context for specific usage instructions and best practices.
